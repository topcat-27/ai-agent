# Upgrade to v0.3

v0.3 makes agent selection real: each of the five agents receives only its own instructions, saved context, and connected tools. It also adds the accessible agent-card interface, restores daily Funding Radar scheduling, makes SEO writing free-first, removes the LinkedIn fallback the n8n agent could not run, and catalogues cloud-only Telegram and global Scheduler add-ons.

Xero is not included in this release. Bookkeeping is a safe routable role with no accounting connector.

## Before either path

Run the read-only preflight from the project folder:

```bash
npm run upgrade-check
```

It reports source changes, installed skills, workflow schema readiness, sync state, setup workflows to confirm, and the next commands. It does not alter files, workflows, tables, credentials, or learner data.

## Fresh learner

1. Download or clone the v0.3.0 base.
2. Run `setup.command` on macOS or `setup-windows.cmd` on Windows.
3. Start the agent with the matching start helper.
4. Add only the skill packages you want. Use
   `npm run add-skill -- <package-id>` or give Claude Code the package's
   `skill-packs/<package-id>` GitHub folder URL. Direct optional-module IDs and
   URLs remain supported for older instructions.
5. Run `npm run import-workflows`.
6. Run each installed skill's numbered setup workflow when its README names one.
7. Run `npm run sync-skills` and restart.
8. Run `npm run verify` and `npm run diagnose`.
9. Open a new conversation and smoke-test only the agents whose skills you installed.

The base intentionally contains the four Project Manager modules, presented as
one Meeting to Actions package. Its card still lists two Sales packages, two
Marketing packages, and one Investment package as not installed, so learners
can see what is available without loading those instructions. Bookkeeping has
no package and must say when accounting capability is unavailable.

## Existing v0.2 learner

Do these in order. The order protects your chats, profile data, credentials, and customised source files.

1. Create a backup:

   ```bash
   npm run backup
   ```

2. Stop the agent:

   ```bash
   npm run stop
   ```

3. Commit intentional source customisations, or copy those changed source files somewhere outside the project. `data/` is already outside Git but is included in the backup.
4. Pull v0.3.0, or apply only the commits listed in [FEATURE_SLICES.md](FEATURE_SLICES.md).
5. Install the pinned dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm ci
   ```

6. Import workflows before syncing skills:

   ```bash
   npm run import-workflows
   npm run sync-skills
   ```

   This order is required. Workflow `00` contains the five-agent graph and workflow `11` accepts the schema-v2 skill bundle; the old workflows cannot safely consume the new sync result.

7. Run any idempotent setup or migration workflow named by `npm run upgrade-check` and the selected slice map. Funding Radar users with an older `funding_runs` table must add its `runId` text column as described in [FUNDING_RADAR.md](FUNDING_RADAR.md).
8. Restart:

   ```bash
   npm run restart
   ```

9. Verify and diagnose:

   ```bash
   npm run verify
   npm run diagnose
   ```

10. Smoke-test the agents you use:

    - Project Manager: analyse a short meeting note; action items should use plain `-` lines.
    - Marketing: ask for a domain research scan, then an article; no paid research should start unless explicitly requested.
    - Investment: read the existing Funding Radar report, then start one only if you intend to spend its documented cost.
    - Sales: named-person lookup and group prospect search are separate
      packages. With neither installed, it must say live LinkedIn capability is
      unavailable. Each installed Crustdata call needs fresh cost approval.
    - Bookkeeping: it must say no accounting tool is installed; v0.3 contains no Xero connector.

## What is preserved

- `data/chat/chat.sqlite` and saved conversation history;
- `data/profile/` business and per-agent settings;
- the encrypted n8n database, credentials, and tables under `data/n8n/`;
- installed optional skill files unless a selected slice deliberately changes them;
- learner source customisations you committed or copied before pulling.

Do not run `npm run reset` during an upgrade. Reset deletes local runtime state and belongs only in a disposable clean-machine rehearsal.

## If you want only one capability

For a skill, prefer its `skill-packs/<id>` folder and package installer. For a
runtime/UI change, give Claude Code [FEATURE_SLICES.md](FEATURE_SLICES.md) and
say which slice you want. It should apply the prerequisites, preserve your
changes, use the slice's exact verification command, and stop on a real
conflict rather than replacing a shared file wholesale.
